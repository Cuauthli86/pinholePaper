We explore paper augmentation technique where a tablet computer is placed bellow the paper to modify its content appearance and create the illusion of making static object perceptually dynamic. Our approach is based on Deformation Lampss (DL) technique applied to rear projection (instead of commonly used front projection), which removes the need for fix setups or handling and wearing dedicated hardware. The key challenge is to ensure appropriate mixing of light reflecting from the paper (e.g. what is printed on the paper) and the light that is coming though the paper (e.g. tablet screen). This is particularly the case as a relatively week light source of a tablet screen is being used. We address this through modification of optical properties of paper with perforation and a new method for generating dynamic luminance imaging which successful make static object perceptually dynamic. The outcomes provide a guide to how paper needs to be modified in order to achieve the illusion of making static object perceptually dynamic.
